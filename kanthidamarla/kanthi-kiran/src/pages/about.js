          <p>
            Hi. i'm Kanthi you can also call me a product designer, interaction,
            UI, UX or by any other market defined title.{' '}
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I don't like to define myself by the work I've done. I define myself
            by the work I'm going to do. Skills can be taught, personality is
            inherent. I prefer to keep learning continuously and challenge
            myself to do intresting things
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I'm never satisfied to just come up with ideas. Instead I have an
            almost impulsive need to act on them.
          </p>
          <p>
            I value simple content structure, clean design patterns, and
            thoughtful interactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            I genuinely care about people, and love helping fellow designers
            work on their craft.
          </p>
          <p>
            I‚Äôm a fast learner, able to pick up new skills and juggle different
            projects and roles with relative ease.
          </p>
          <p>
            I like to develop expertise in a number of areas over the course of
            my life and career.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bored about my details.....
            <br />
            Then Look about my Life üòú
